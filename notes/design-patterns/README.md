## What is a Design Pattern?

Designs patterns are pre-made blueprints that we can customize to solve a repeating problem in our application.

## Pattern Groups:
1. **Creational Patterns:** Provides flexible ways to create objects while hiding creation logic and make the system independent of how objects are created.
2. **Structural Patterns:** Explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures while keeping them flexible and efficient
3. **Behavioral Patterns:** Define how objects interact and communicate with each other, handling algorithms and assignment of responsibilities
