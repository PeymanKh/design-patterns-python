## SOLID Principles (Fundamental Rules For Better OOP Code)

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):** Each class only has one job. The main goal is to reduce complexity.
2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP):** Classes are open for extension, closed for modification. The main idea is to keep existing code from breaking when you implement new features.
3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):** Subclasses can stand in for parent classes without issues.
4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):** Don’t force classes to implement interfaces they don’t use.
5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):** Depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations.
